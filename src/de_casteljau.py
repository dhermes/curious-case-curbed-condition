r"""Performs de Casteljau's method.

de Casteljau's method evaluates a function in Bernstein-Bezier form

.. math::

    p(s) = p_0 (1 - s)^n + \cdots + p_j \binom{n}{j} (1 - s)^{n - j} s^j +
        \cdots + p_n s^n

by progressively reducing the control points

.. math::

    \begin{align*}
    p_j^{(0)} &= p_j \\
    p_j^{(k + 1)} &= (1 - s) p_j^{(k)} + p_{j + 1}^{(k)} \\
    p(s) &= p_0^{(n)}.
    \end{align*}

.. note::

   This assumes throughout that ``coeffs`` is ordered from
   :math:`p_n` to :math:`p_0`.
